# Hypotheis
The average alcohol content of Red Wine and White Wine are equal when wine is of above average quality.  Above average is defined as quality at 7 or above.

## Hypothesis
mu_{white} = mu_{red}

## x-bar				
The arithmetic mean alcohol content of White Wine: 14.364

## mu_0
The value the null hypothesis is being tested against: 11.518

## n
Sample size of White Wine with Quality at or above 7: 1060

## Test Statistic
Measurement of the agreement between a sample of data and the null hypothesis: -2.646

## Critical Value
Measurement of uncertainty in sample data used to make inferences about a population: -1.646

## p-value
The probability of obtaining a test statistic result is at least as extreme as the test statistic observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true: 0.008

# Results
With a test statistic of -2.646 being less than the critical value of -1.646, reject the null hypothesis.  Also, with a p-value less than 0.05, reject the null hypothesis.
