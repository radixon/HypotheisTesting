## Hypothesis Testing
The process of making inferences about the overall population by conducting some statistical tests on a sample.  Null and alternate hypotheses are ways to validate whether an assumption is statistically significant.

## x-bar				
The arithmetic mean

## \mu_0
The value the null hypothesis is being tested against

## n
Sample size

## Test Statistic
A test statistic measures the agreement between a sample of data and the null hypothesis

## Critical Value
A critical value defines regions in the sampling distribution of a test statistic.  Critical values account for uncertainty in sample data used to make inferences about a population

## p-value
The probability of obtaining a test statistic result is at least as extreme as the test statistic observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true.
